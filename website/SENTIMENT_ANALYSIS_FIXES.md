# Sentiment Analysis Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Rate Limiting and Concurrent Request Handling
**Problem**: The FastAPI sentiment analysis service was getting overwhelmed when receiving multiple concurrent requests, resulting in "Not Found" errors.

**Solution**: Implemented a request queue system in `SentimentService` with:
- Maximum concurrent requests limit (3 requests at a time)
- Request queuing to prevent overwhelming the API
- Proper timeout handling using AbortController
- Better error logging and fallback handling

### 2. Timeout Handling
**Problem**: Requests were hanging indefinitely when the FastAPI service was slow or unresponsive.

**Solution**: 
- Added 10-second timeout for each request
- Used AbortController for better compatibility across Node.js versions
- Proper cleanup of timeouts in finally blocks

### 3. Batch Processing Improvements
**Problem**: Large file uploads were sending all messages for sentiment analysis simultaneously, causing API overload.

**Solution**:
- Implemented batch processing with configurable batch size (5 texts per batch)
- Added delays between batches to prevent overwhelming the API
- Progress logging for better debugging

### 4. Error Handling and Fallback
**Problem**: When sentiment analysis failed, the entire upload process would fail.

**Solution**:
- Improved error messages with HTTP status codes
- Graceful fallback to neutral sentiment when API is unavailable
- Better logging for debugging failed requests

## Code Changes

### Modified Files:
1. `src/lib/services/sentiment.ts` - Complete rewrite with queue system and better error handling
2. Error handling improvements throughout the sentiment analysis pipeline

### Key Features Added:
1. **Request Queue System**: Prevents API overload by limiting concurrent requests
2. **Timeout Protection**: 10-second timeout for each sentiment analysis request
3. **Batch Processing**: Processes large files in smaller chunks
4. **Fallback Mode**: Gracefully handles API failures with neutral sentiment
5. **Enhanced Logging**: Better debugging information for sentiment analysis

## Testing

To test the improvements:

1. Start the FastAPI service: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
2. Start the Next.js app: `npm run dev`
3. Upload a conversation file with multiple messages
4. Check the console logs for sentiment analysis progress

## Expected Behavior

- Sentiment analysis requests are now queued and processed with rate limiting
- Failed requests fallback to neutral sentiment instead of crashing
- Better error messages and logging for debugging
- Large files are processed in batches to prevent API overload

## API Response Format

FastAPI returns:
```json
{
  "original_text": "هذه الشركة ممتازة وأنصح بها",
  "processed_text": "هذه ال+ شرك +ة ممتاز +ة و+ أنصح ب+ +ها",
  "predicted_class": "positive",
  "confidence": 0.98866206407547,
  "all_probabilities": {
    "0": 0.005007142666727305,  // negative
    "1": 0.006330822594463825,  // neutral
    "2": 0.98866206407547       // positive
  }
}
```

Our app converts this to:
```json
{
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "confidence": 0.98866206407547,
  "scores": {
    "negative": 0.005007142666727305,
    "neutral": 0.006330822594463825,
    "positive": 0.98866206407547
  }
}
```
